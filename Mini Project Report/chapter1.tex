\section{Background Information}
Managing large projects can become a hassle if it is not managed efficiently. A mechanism is required to divide the tasks and set deadlines for the successful completion of the project. A project management system is thus required for the team that enables tracking of progress and management of tasks.

\section{Literature Survey}
The project management system implements Kanban boards for achieving its functionality\cite{a1}. More features are added to improve the Kanban framework for effective progress tracking\cite{a2}. The web app was implemented using the MERN stack.\cite{a3}

\section{Problem Statement}
Large scale collaborative projects require effective tracking of work. When the number of such projects increases, managing them becomes difficult.  In practice, their management requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies. To solve this problem a project management system is required.

\section{Outline of the Report}
This report describes the functionalities that our project management web app provides to its end-users. It also shows the detailed design of the system through various use case diagrams and specifies the implementation details. The project management system is an improved open source web app that helps in effectively managing projects, tasks and distributing work among team members.
