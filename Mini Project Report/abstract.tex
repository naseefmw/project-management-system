\chapter*{Abstract}
Project management involves planning, organizing, and managing resources in order to successfully meet project goals and objectives. This is accomplished through the use of processes, which are discrete units of work that are required for the completion of a project.
Our task is to develop a web-based application that will allow for the management of a project through the maintenance of a database that will contain each of the processes required for the project as well as the inputs and outputs of each of the processes. Furthermore, the application will provide the users with a visual representation of the processes used in the project as well as the dependencies among those processes.
